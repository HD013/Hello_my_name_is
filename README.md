## Thanks for stopping by!

Allow me to introduce myself:


I am a research biologist and data scientist. I was fortunate to do some cool work with species interactions involving chemial defenses. I used clues embbeded in a species metabolome (sort of like a chemical genome) - to draw conclusions about how they interact in the present and about they're evolutionary history. Check below if you'd like to read deeper into chemically mediated interactions between species.

 <br>

 The work with chemical interactions was computationally intensive, with thousands of individual compounds identified within each single group of (plant) speices. The learning curve to pick up this chemical analysis pipeline was intense. This and other projects had me repeatedly idenifiy a problem or question, apply the appropriate stastical model to answer or test it, and then (struggle to) code it up, and present the results.

 <br>

 During COVID my work was more analytical than in the field. I came to love the challenge of solving unique puzzles and presenting them in a fun, clear way. The ability to solve a problem statistically is a skill that extends far beyond research or evolutionary biology. I am rearing to get out and apply this way of learning to other challenges. Read: I am looking for jobs that involve problem solveing (and hopefully coding), interesting projects and people ;)

Learn more about me and sample some of my work. Reach out if something catches your eye, I am always looking for collaborators.
